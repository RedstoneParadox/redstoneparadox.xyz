# Welcome to my Website!

I am RedstoneParadox, a hobbyist programmer from a place that hopefully exists.

I started out modding minecraft way back in 2017 and since then, I've made several mods for a few different games along with a number of other programming projects, including a bit of game dev.

I've also dabbled a bit in making music with tools like VCV Rack.

As you can see, my website is a bit barebones at the moment; come back in the future and there will be more to see here, I promise!

In the meantime, my social links are down below and the link to my maven is up top. Thanks for visiting!
