You know, if you had told me 10 years ago that I would become a Minecraft modder, set up my own website with a maven repository and a blog - including setting up the backend myself via docker - I would have told you that you were crazy. Actually, I probably would have asked "Do I know you?", since, you know, I wouldn't have known who you were.

Anyways, yeah, I have a blog now (which you obviously already know, since you're reading it) - and it's come on the heels of a facelift for my website as well, which you may not have realized if you're reading this at some point in the future. It still needs some polish here and there, but I think I've finally nailed down a good look for the site. Maybe I'll talk about that in a future blog post.

As for what I'm going to use this for, it's mostly going to be devlogs about my project, but I may branch out to other things like discussions of the software world, book/movie/show reviews, and random thoughs about random things. I might even tackle extremely controversial topics such as NuTrek and the Minecraft mob vote, lol.
